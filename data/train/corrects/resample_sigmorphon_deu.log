Found 2662 correct samples to replace from SIGMORPHON training
Performing initial sampling to match lemmas and MSDs as much as possible
Found 1102 replacement samples with lemmas overlapping the corrects
Initial sampling complete (1392). Sampling more seen/unseen lemmas 
from leftover SIGMORPHON (9300)
Corrects seen/unseen: 124//2538

Resampling from 2662 SIGMORPHON samples
Replaced corrects with new samples. 0 unused new samples remain.
482 (50.0)% SIGMOPRPHON dev are seen in original SIGMOPRPHON train
