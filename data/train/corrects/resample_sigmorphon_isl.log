Found 1164 correct samples to replace from SIGMORPHON training
Performing initial sampling to match lemmas and MSDs as much as possible
Found 456 replacement samples with lemmas overlapping the corrects
Initial sampling complete (706). Sampling more seen/unseen lemmas 
from leftover SIGMORPHON (9804)
Corrects seen/unseen: 74//1090
Number of new samples with seen lemma:107
Number of new samples with unseen lemma:599
Redistributing 33 samples from seen lemmas to sample unseen lemmas.Resulting in 74 new seen lemmas

Resampling from 1164 SIGMORPHON samples
Replaced corrects with new samples. 0 unused new samples remain.
795 (87.75)% SIGMOPRPHON dev are seen in original SIGMOPRPHON train
