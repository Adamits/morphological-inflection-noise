Found 768 correct samples to replace from SIGMORPHON training
Performing initial sampling to match lemmas and MSDs as much as possible
Found 162 replacement samples with lemmas overlapping the corrects
Initial sampling complete (226). Sampling more seen/unseen lemmas 
from leftover SIGMORPHON (9822)
Corrects seen/unseen: 18//750
Number of new samples with seen lemma:12
Number of new samples with unseen lemma:214
Requesting 6 seen lemmas from sigmorphon (806)
Requesting 536 unseen lemmas from sigmorphon (9016)
Resampling from 768 SIGMORPHON samples
Replaced corrects with new samples. 0 unused new samples remain.
555 (58.05)% SIGMOPRPHON dev are seen in original SIGMOPRPHON train

Summarizing dataset modifications after resampling:
Resampled dataset lemma overlap with old: 21.88%
Resampled dataset MSD overlap with old: 52.34%
old seen/unseen: 18/750
new seen/unseen: 18/750
