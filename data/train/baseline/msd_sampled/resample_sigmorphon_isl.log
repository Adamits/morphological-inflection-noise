Found 1797 correct samples to replace from SIGMORPHON training
Performing initial sampling to match lemmas and MSDs as much as possible
Found 620 replacement samples with lemmas overlapping the corrects
Initial sampling complete (983). Sampling more seen/unseen lemmas 
from leftover SIGMORPHON (5912)
Corrects seen/unseen: 107//1690
Number of new samples with seen lemma:136
Number of new samples with unseen lemma:847
Redistributing 29 samples from seen lemmas to sample unseen lemmas.Resulting in 107 new seen lemmas
Requesting 843 unseen lemmas from sigmorphon (4661)
Resampling from 1797 SIGMORPHON samples
Replaced corrects with new samples. 0 unused new samples remain.
665 (73.4)% SIGMOPRPHON dev are seen in original SIGMOPRPHON train

Summarizing dataset modifications after resampling:
