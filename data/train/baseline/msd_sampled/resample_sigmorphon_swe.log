Found 1689 correct samples to replace from SIGMORPHON training
Performing initial sampling to match lemmas and MSDs as much as possible
Found 405 replacement samples with lemmas overlapping the corrects
Initial sampling complete (558). Sampling more seen/unseen lemmas 
from leftover SIGMORPHON (7944)
Corrects seen/unseen: 48//1641
Number of new samples with seen lemma:32
Number of new samples with unseen lemma:526
Requesting 16 seen lemmas from sigmorphon (628)

Resampling from 1689 SIGMORPHON samples
Replaced corrects with new samples. 0 unused new samples remain.
470 (49.16)% SIGMOPRPHON dev are seen in original SIGMOPRPHON train
