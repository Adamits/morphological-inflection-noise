Reading tUMPC and stats
Reading UniMorph inflection pairs
Filtering uni pairs to only those with MSDs in the set of tUMPC correct data
Second filtering stage: keeping only those with lemmas in tUMPC

 464 out of 15060 UniMorph lemmas overlap with tUMPC correct data.
This comprises 3044638 pairs.
Got 57922 UniMorph samples with both lemma AND msd overlapping tUMPC corrects

SAMPLING from additional lemmas to increase diversity.
Adding 30 new lemmas comprising 2189 pairs.
